# paperview-js

## Purpose and usage

@todo

## Viewer containers, width, height and scale


@todo

The top `.viewer-container` must be set to absolute and its `width` and `height` must be set (to pixels or 100% for both).

`npm run watch` and open `dist/index.html` with a virtual host (won't work otherwise because of cross origin requests)
