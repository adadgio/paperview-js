# paperview-js

## Purpose and usage

The javscritp client for paperview which allows to view any transformed document in the browser or mobile. An perfect
replacement solution for the legacy *Crocodoc* and *Box View API* clients.

This library is able to displayconverted assets (see paperview-server) but also old Crocodoc or Box View legacy assets.

@todo

## Viewer containers, width, height and scale


## Developement

Run `npm run watch` and point a virtual host to `/dist/index.html` (otherwise won't work because of cross origin requests browser constraints).
